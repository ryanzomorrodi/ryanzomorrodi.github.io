I have had to do a fair number of assignments in SAS, and whenever I did
I missed the ability to simply include all my code and my comments in a single 
reproducable rmarkdown/quarto document. When I first came across 
[this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c9T6-__vI8) by Johann 
Laurent, I became excited. BaselR had introduced a package, [`configSAS`](https://github.com/baselr/configSAS) 
that allowed me to use SAS with all the nicities that come with quarto!

When I set `configSAS` up, I became a little disappointed. There was no syntax
highlighting, the SAS output's CSS caused weird styling behavior throughout the 
rest of the quarto document, and I couldn't see any SAS output unless I rendered
the entire quarto document over again. Still, I thought this was better than 
nothing. I continued to use `configSAS` for almost a year until I decided there 
had to be a better way. That's what `sasquatch` aims to be.

`sasquatch` gives you the ability to work with SAS interactively just as you
would R or Python, but within your R IDE of choice. And it allows you render
beautiful quarto documents with syntax highlighting. You can even send tables
between R and SAS to do your analysis in whatever language is easiest!

I won't lie, a few of the solutions I had to use were a little janky. Syntax 
highlighting is provided by a separate xml file specified in the quarto options. 
The SAS output is rendered inside an iframe, which is dynamically resized to fit
its contents using a javascript library linked in the quarto options and within
each iframe. Hopefully, I can think of more elegant solutions to these problems,
but in the mean time, check it out!
