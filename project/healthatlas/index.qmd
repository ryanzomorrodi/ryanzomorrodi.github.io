`healthatlas` is an unofficial R wrapper for Metopio atlases. Users can explore 
and download public health data straight from any atlas. This makes R workflows
that rely on atlas data more painless and reproducable.

I developed healthatlas in part as an exploration of `httr2` functionality and
to develop an easier way to download data from the Chicago Health Atlas (I find
the website interface for downloading data a little inconvenient).
