The Rate Stabilizing Tool(box) 2 is an ArcGIS Pro python toolbox for generating 
reliable, local-level age-standardized measures of chronic disease developed 
from scratch in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
to replace the original Rate Stabilizing Tool.

It composed of two tools:

- Individual Data Processing Tool (IDP): Aggregates individual data to an 
  optionally age stratified population table and preforms checks to warn user if
  input data is invalid.
- Rate Stabilizing Tool (RST): Utilizes a restricted CAR model to generate 
  optionally age adjusted rates for local areas given the population data from 
  the IDP and a geographic layer.

It improves on the original RST by radically simplifying the interface, speeding
up estimatation time, and providing better error/warning messaging.
