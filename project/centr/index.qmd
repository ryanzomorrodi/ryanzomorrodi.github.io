`centr` is a package designed to calculate population weighted mean or median
spatial centers. Mean centers can be calculated for projected and lon lat 
geometries. `centr` assumes a spherical representation of the earth for lon lat
geometries, similar to S2.

Population weighted centroids are a powerful tool to calculate plausible 
population exposure measures, and I use them quite a bit in my work. Now with
`centr` calculating population weighted centroids within R is easy and fast.
