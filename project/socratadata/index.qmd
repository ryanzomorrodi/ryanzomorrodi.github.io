`socratadata` is an unofficial R wrapper around the Socrata Data, Metadata, and Discovery APIs which utilizes Rust :crab: to parse Socrata datatypes into R columns. The City of Chicago currently maintains another R package, `socratadata` improves upon the existing [`RSocrata`](https://dev.socrata.com/connectors/rsocrata) package by introducing support for the Socrata Discovery API and all Socrata datatypes. Additionally, `socratadata` allows for easy use of [Socrata Query Language (SoQL)](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/).

Between `socratadata` and `healthatlas`, you can easily import any dataset into R from both Chicago's major data repositories, the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) and [Chicago Health Atlas](https://chicagohealthatlas.org/). And countless other government data repositories are supported, like the [Centers for Disease Control & Prevention](https://data.cdc.gov/), [U.S. Department of Transportation](https://data.transportation.gov/), and many more.
