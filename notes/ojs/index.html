<p>Over the past year I have been playing around with quarto and trying to learn more about some of its features. I have really been enjoying the fact that quarto allows me to chain my R and python scripts into one single reproducable document. But why should I stop there?</p>
<p>The following are my notes about using objective js to make data visualization as some one who primarily uses ggplot2.</p>
<section id="ggplot2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ggplot2">ggplot2</h2>
<p>ggplot2 was built with an underlying grammar, the Grammar of Graphics. This breaks down visualizations into 7 parts.</p>
<p><a href="gg.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="gg.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><strong>Data</strong> (<code>ggplot()</code>) - should be self-explanatory<br>
<strong>Mapping</strong> (<code>aes()</code>) - Defines relationship between data and aesthetic attributes of layers<br>
<strong>Layers</strong> (<code>geom_*</code> or <code>stat_*</code>) - specifies graphical components displayed in a visualization<br>
<strong>Scales</strong> (<code>scale_*_*</code>) - sets the axes, legends, and sometimes transformations<br>
<strong>Facets</strong> (<code>facet_*</code>) - splits up data into separate panels<br>
<strong>Coordinates</strong> (<code>coord_*</code>) - determines the coordinate system used to display elements<br>
<strong>Themes</strong> (<code>theme*()</code>) - control the look and feel of the plot elements</p>
<p>Note: these are one line summaries of a much better description within the ggplot vignette, <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html"><em>Introduction to ggplot2</em></a></p>
<p>While this makes ggplot2 relatively easy to learn, but not all graphics libraries rely on this exact grammar. I will; however, try as best I can to translate the javascipt libraries used throughout these notes to this underlying grammar.</p>
</section>
<section id="translating-to-plot.js" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="translating-to-plot.js">Translating to Plot.js</h2>
<p>I know you want to become the next NYT visualization guru, but first let’s try to make some simplish, but powerful plots with Plot.js. Plot.js is build on d3, which is the visualization library that your favorite NYT data viz wizards use. Its syntax is quite a lot easier to translate into ggplot methods as compared to d3 so this is where we will start.</p>
<p>Since, we are focused on data viz.&nbsp;I’m going to get my data from R and send it over to javascript using <code>ojs_define()</code>.</p>

<p>This is where we experience our first sort of problem. ggplot2 layers often calculate stats for us. In this case ggplot2 calculates a count of each of the species and maps that to the y of each bar. Plot.js will not do this. We need to first calculate our stat and specify it as our y. (imagine you were only able to use <code>geom_col()</code>).</p>
